#### Pumpkin Reader React + React Native
This is our attempt to develop Pumpkin Reader using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) technology.

We try to reuse the code as many as possible.

The functionality is far from complete. Currently, it can only show 10 news title (Yes, only the title. You can not even click on it to view the comments).

```

#### Code reusability
Actions (47) + Reducers (46) + Store (17) = 110 lines

View = (Android) 140 + (Web) 98 = 238

**Reusability: 110 / (238 + 110) â‰… 31.6%**
